Abstract:
The thing that really made me want to base my research on low income housing neighborhoods is seeing the lack of awareness that people bring into this topic. And the government doesn't do anything to help prevent any more sickness that people face in those neighborhoods. The rich are benefitting from this by being able to buy houses in low poverty neighborhoods and renovating those areas so more rich people can come and live there but the people that live there before get displaced. I used Scatter Plots and columns to prove my research. My research came out to prove my hypothesis by showing that crime rates are more  likely to occur in low income neighborhoods because people feel like they are free to do anything and people tend to steal and rob people to live. 
Background:
Better life index often is used to compare the well-being of humans across the world. When I wrote my research question, I wanted to think about something that I see is still going on in the world and it’s not often spoken about. So my research question was “Does low-incoming housing in high-poverty neighbourhoods raise crime, and create harmful healthcare risks?” My research question is important because it is asking me to find the negative side effect that people have to live with in low income communities. With my research question, it makes people aware of the outcomes of being in those neighborhoods. 
My hypothesis: Neighborhoods with a lot of low‑income housing tend to have more crime and a harmful environment that causes serious health problems than high income housing neighborhoods.
